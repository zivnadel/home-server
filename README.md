# Home Server

In my house, we needed a simple "shared folder" with a friendly interface to manage, store and share files between devices in the local network, so I created this system, written entirely in TypeScript, including a friendly and simple GUI built with Electron and React, and a server created with Node and Express.

## Overview

As I mentioned, this system includes a GUI and a server.
