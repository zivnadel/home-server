# Home Server

In my house, we needed a simple "shared folder" with a friendly interface to manage, store and share files between devices in the local network, so I created this system, written entirely in TypeScript, including a friendly and simple GUI built with Electron and React, and a server created with Node and Express.
It was a fun experiment creating this system entirely in the JavaScript ecosystem and it is actually very useful, simple and fast.

## Overview

As I mentioned, this system includes a GUI and a server.

### User Interface


### Server


## Usage

## Technologies Used

TypeScript, Electron.js, Webpack, Electron Forge, React.js, react-router-dom (v6), Tailwind CSS, Axios, Node.js, Express.js, Multer and more.

## Coming Soon

I will add more features to this system when needed, as well as additional interface for mobile devices (probably in React Native).
